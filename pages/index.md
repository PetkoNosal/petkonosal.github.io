Hello there!
My name is Å oponka, or Etttska for short...
I really, really like to draw, and people around me
seems to really, really like what I'm usually drawing.
I want to share those pieces of art with more people so
here we are, Welcome to my portfolio!!!

My usual style is to draw something that is as cute as I am myself :)
So if you are interested in uber cuteness level over 9000, please check
out my work in the Gallery section, and if you like something there,
feel free to tell your friends about it or even better,
you can share my work on your favorite social media.

And now, best part comes... I'm not just a regular, everyday, normal artist...
Au contraire my bellowed visitor! 
I am more than happy to draw something for you!!!
If you like my style, and want me to draw something for you,
I will be more than happy to do so :)

But... this is a feature for another day :) For now, just enjoy what you see
and I thank you for visiting...
